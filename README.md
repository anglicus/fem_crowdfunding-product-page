## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Sass


### What I learned

This was my first time using Sass, and I learned a lot. I tried using custom variables, formulas and mixins. I think the result was not as efficient as it could have been, but next time I believe I can apply what I learned here from the start and do a cleaner job.

### Continued development

I'm going to continue working on more complex projects, and learn how to use Sass better.
